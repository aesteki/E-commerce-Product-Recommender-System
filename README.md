# E-commerce-Product-Recommender-System
Built a product recommender system for e-commerce website users by applying collaborative filtering and the Pearson correlation coefficient. The preprocessing step included EDA and tuning hyperparameters and Python libraries, including NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn were used.
This project involves developing a product recommender system for e-commerce website users using collaborative filtering and the Pearson correlation coefficient. The goal of the recommender system is to make personalized product recommendations to users based on their past behavior and preferences.

The preprocessing step included Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the data and identify any issues or patterns. Hyperparameters were then tuned to optimize the performance of the model. To implement the recommender system, Python libraries such as NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn were used.

Collaborative filtering is a commonly used technique for recommendation systems. It makes recommendations based on the past behavior and preferences of users, rather than the attributes of the products themselves. The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to measure the similarity between users and their past behavior.

Once the model was trained, it was used to make recommendations to users based on their past behavior and preferences. The model was then evaluated on its performance to ensure that it was making accurate and relevant recommendations.

The end goal of this project was to provide a user-friendly and effective product recommender system for an e-commerce website, to help users discover new products that they may be interested in based on their past behavior and preferences.
